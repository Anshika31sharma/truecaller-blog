# Truecaller Blog App

A responsive blog web app inspired by the Truecaller Blog. It fetches posts from a backend and displays them with category filters and detailed views.

## üìù Brief Explanation

This app is a React-based frontend that:

- Fetches blog data from a backend via `posts.js`
- Displays a list of blog posts
- Supports category-based filtering and pagination
- Shows full blog content on a separate page
- Component-based architecture (React)
- CSS styling for responsiveness
- Pagination logic
- Simple routing (via `react-router-dom`)

## ‚ö° Assumptions & Shortcuts

- **Backend Data**: Posts are fetched using an API call defined in `posts.js`.
- **Simple Pagination & Filtering**: Implemented manually on frontend based on fetched data.
- **Minimal UI Styling**: Focus was on functionality, so styling is basic and responsive without using any design libraries.
- **Basic Testing**: Includes one UI-level test to confirm core layout renders as expected.
